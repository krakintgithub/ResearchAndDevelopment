the minted Coins.  4. After a long time the minted coins will be sold (or the Krakin'ts sold) to get more coins. When all Krakin't are mined, Krakin't is burned to start the next generation. For example when the BTC mining algorithm is improved enough. When all Krakin't are mined, and the minted coins sold they then become untapped and the next generation will include both BTC and Krakin't coin values. This way the next generation coin value will automatically adjust to the coin balance of the previous generation. (Note : If you think you know better than my algorithm - write in the comments ! ) When all Krakin't are mined and burned as part of the next generation, any remaining BTC is sold and Krakin't coins are rerouted to other accounts. But the next generation coins will remain in there unburned indefinitely, for as long as they may be needed. This means they can't be exchanged for more coin in the coin market without losing value. The coins will stay at constant market price when burned by the next generation as long we wait. This means if we want to reduce the market capitalization as soon as possible before the next generation gets created, we must reduce the value of the next generation coins. (this is similar to the trade value of Bitcoin which is the market capitalization of coins, before they become available as an "easy-to-buy" item) The best time would be when all Krakin't are mined and burned as part of the next generation for its own profit and to provide a "coin value" boost in their market value, after we have made most of the coins available again. However, after this point, any Krakin't coins will have to be rerouted to other accounts on a daily basis for the remaining coins. Also, as we burn them, they will need to be burned more (to generate more coins). It should be possible to trade these Krakin't coins as part of a trading operation. So far we burn them from a daily basis, so we can't sell them, but they will become liquid and they will be traded. We will have to be careful that those coins make it to us as quickly as possible after we've burnt them for now, as the burned coins (when burned) are not fungible, so they will end up like gold. And, with the burnt coins, we can take them for future coin burning. 1. How many coins can we burn?

So much stuff going on!

After all, if people don't come to us if they don't feel comfortable being treated appropriately, where will we be able to work with them?

Please help us bring more people into our team and keep them from leaving!

Thank you
